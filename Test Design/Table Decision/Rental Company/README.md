<p>The rental company folder contains separate decision tables for different requirements. </p>

    Combining all the requirements into one table would have made it overly complex and difficult to maintain, so I chose a more modular approach 😅

      So instead, I created a decision table for each requirement, optimized them, and removed all unnecessary or meaningless checks 🧹✨

  <p>🔎 Before developing the test cases, I analyzed the requirements. </p>

  <p>
   📝 Based on this analysis, I created individual decision tables for each requirement to keep the logic clear and manageable. Each table was 
    optimized to avoid redundant or irrelevant checks, ensuring a clean and focused design.
  </p>

  <p>
   📎 Once the decision tables were finalized, I used them as the foundation for designing test cases.
