      The rental company folder contains separate decision tables for different requirements.
      <br><br>
     Combining all the requirements into one table would have made it overly complex and difficult to maintain, so I chose a more modular approach ðŸ˜…
      <br><br>
      So instead, I created a decision table for each requirement, optimized them, and removed all unnecessary or meaningless checks ðŸ§¹âœ¨
