<p>This application calculates the final amount a customer needs to pay based on the price of the goods, total weight, and payment method. <br>
  The price calculation includes multiple rules regarding discounts, free delivery, and combined reductions depending on thresholds like product price (e.g., 100 €, 200 €), total weight (5 kg), and the use of credit card payment.</p>
<p>Also, you can view the already developed documentation at the following link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13wWy39g8fIQr1-T_C0UPACDsUikkPvMm4iH5cbrgZ88/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Price Calculation (Google Sheet).</p>
