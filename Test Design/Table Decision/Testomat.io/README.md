<h1>ðŸ“ŽThe 'Choose File' feature</h1>

I created a decision table for the "Choose File" feature used in import tests.
I selected three parameters for the table: **Format**, **Contain tests**, **Size**.

The feature accepts only two formats: **xls**, **.csv**.
The valid size is **less than 2 GB**
The _Contain tests_ parameter is used to check the behavior when a user tries to upload a file that doesn't contain any tests for import into Testomat.io.
