# Credit Rate Estimation app ğŸ’¾ğŸ’µ
Given the description of a program's logic that calculates the interest rate based on the number of days in the credit term, as well as the reduction of this rate depending on the loan amount.

For which input values will you test the following logic, considering that the values for the days of the credit term and the loan amount are entered into specially designated fields? The program sets the interest rate for the loan based on its term and amount:

    Loan term up to 92 days â€“ base interest rate = 20%
    Loan term from 93 to 182 days â€“ base interest rate = 19%
    Loan term from 183 to 365 days â€“ base interest rate = 18%
    If the loan amount is up to 50,000, the base interest rate remains unchanged
    If the loan amount is from 50,000 to 100,000, the base interest rate is reduced by 0.5%
    If the loan amount is over 100,000, the base interest rate is reduced by 1.5%
