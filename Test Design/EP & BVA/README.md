# Equivalence Partitioning (EP) & Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

This document explains two key black-box test design techniques used in software testing:

- **Equivalence Partitioning (EP)**
- **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**

These techniques help reduce the number of test cases while ensuring effective coverage of input conditions.
