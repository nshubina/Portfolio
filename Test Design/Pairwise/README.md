# 🗺️ Pairwise Test Case Generation

<p>This project demonstrates the use of **pairwise (all-pairs) testing** — a test design technique aimed at reducing the number of test cases while preserving maximum coverage of input combinations. Rather than testing all possible permutations, pairwise testing ensures that **every possible pair of input values** appears in at least one test case.</p>
