# Pairwise Testing with PICT

This project uses pairwise testing with PICT to generate an optimized set of test cases for a filter-like feature

Pairwise helps reduce the number of test cases while still covering all value pairs.

The PICT tool reads the input file and outputs efficient test combinations for coverage and validation.
