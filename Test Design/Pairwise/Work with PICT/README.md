# Pairwise Testing with PICT ðŸ§©âœ¨
This project demonstrates the use of pairwise testing with the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pict" target="_blank">PICT tool </a> to efficiently generate a minimized and logically valid set of test cases for a feature resembling a product filter.

# Task
The system under test accepts the following input parameters:
- **Brand**: Samsung, Apple, Lenovo, Xiaomi
- **OS**: Android, iOS
- **Type**: Smartphone, Flip phone
- **Display type**: IPS, OLED, Retina
- **Color**: White, Black, Red, Gray, Gold

The **goal of testing:** 
1. Generate a compact set of test cases that covers all valid pairs of input values.
2. Avoid testing logically invalid or irrelevant combinations by applying constraints.

# Solution

1. I created the <a href="https://github.com/nshubina/Portfolio/blob/cf1616c7d073a48da7526c92ffd5ddafa1bdc9b2/Test%20Design/Pairwise/Work%20with%20PICT/example.txt" targget="_blank">example.txt</a> file listing all values for each parameter and the constraints above.

2. To improve testing efficiency, I added several constraints into the *example.txt* file to exclude invalid combinations that should not be tested:

    `IF [Brand]="Apple" THEN [OS]="iOS";`<br>
    `IF [Brand]="Samsung" OR [Brand]="Lenovo" OR [Brand]="Xiaomi" THEN [OS]="Android";`<br>
    `IF [Type]="Flip phone" THEN NOT [Brand]="Apple" AND NOT [OS]="iOS";`

3. I ran the PICT tool from the console:

4. After launching the PICT tool, I provided the previously created <a href="https://github.com/nshubina/Portfolio/blob/cf1616c7d073a48da7526c92ffd5ddafa1bdc9b2/Test%20Design/Pairwise/Work%20with%20PICT/example.txt" targget="_blank">**example.txt**</a> file as input, allowing the tool to generate an optimized set of test cases based on the defined parameters and constraintsÐ´

4.1 To simplify further access and review, the generated results were saved to <a href="https://github.com/nshubina/Portfolio/blob/89b245ab0c832910766c1f0f38b97957e28de00c/Test%20Design/Pairwise/Work%20with%20PICT/output.txt" target="_blank">output.txt</a>.

# Result
The optimized results generated by PICT are presented in the table below for clarity and ease of use.

| ID | Brand  | OS      | Type         | Display type | Color |
|----|--------|---------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| 1  | Lenovo | Android | Smartphone   | IPS           | Gold   |
| 2  | Apple  | iOS     | Smartphone   | OLED          | Black  |
| 3  | Samsung| Android | Flip phone   | Retina        | Red    |
| 4  | Lenovo | Android | Flip phone   | Retina        | White  |

| 17 | Xiaomi | Android | Flip phone   | Retina        | Gray   |
| 18 | Xiaomi | Android | Flip phone   | OLED          | White  |
| 19 | Apple  | iOS     | Smartphone   | OLED          | Gray   |

# Conclusion

Using pairwise testing with PICT significantly reduced the total number of test cases required. Without optimization, testing all possible combinations of the five parameters would result in:

    4 (Brand) Ã— 2 (OS) Ã— 2 (Type) Ã— 3 (Display type) Ã— 5 (Color) = 240 combinations

However, thanks to pairwise testing and the use of constraints to exclude invalid scenarios, we generated only:

    20 optimized test cases

This means we tested all meaningful pairs while reducing the number of cases by over 90%, saving time and effort without compromising coverage
