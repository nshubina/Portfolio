# Pairwise Testing for Notebook Builder

🧪 In this project, I took a deep dive into the pairwise testing technique by manually breaking down input combinations into pairs and building my own test set.
🎯 My goal was to gain a better understanding of how this approach actually works in practice.

💡 Of course, I realize that pairwise testing is primarily intended to optimize test coverage and reduce the overall number of test cases — and testers don't usually select the pairs manually.
🛠️ However, in this case, I deliberately chose to do it by hand to fully grasp the logic behind the design of pairwise-based test sets.

📊 Additionally, I aimed to compare my manually created test set with the outputs of some of the most popular pairwise testing tools.
