<h1>Hi! 💪</h1>
<p>Here I have attached bug reports 🐞 for the <a href="https://testomat.io/" target="_blank"> <b>Testomat.io</b> </a> and <a href="https://demoqa.com/books" target="_blank"> <b>Book Store</b> </a>applications.</p>
<br>
  <ul>
  <li>The Testomat.io bug reports were created in Jira 📊.</li>
  <br>
  <li>The Book Store bug reports were created in Google Sheets📝. 
    <br>
    Link to bug reports in Google sheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oprHB6L1n0X1c3QTfigsK5AcIUwJCT3QBjTxKwp6fD4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p> Below I demonstrate a mind map of the application. <br>
The map reflects the structure of the website, showing the main pages and the transitions between them from the user's point of view.</p>
