Hi! 👋

Now you can view a sourse code for my landing page :) 🖼️ 

📎
I’ve also included a screenshot and a GIF file, so you can see the site without needing to download the source code. 

This landing page was created to enhance my web design and development skills and to gain a better understanding of testing challenges. HTML was used to set up the page layout, dividing it into sections like the header and events. For styling, CSS was applied to focus on fonts, colors, and overall visual appeal.

Adaptive design was incorporated to ensure the landing page performs well on any device, whether it's a phone, tablet, or computer. This approach guarantees that the site looks good and remains user-friendly across different screen sizes.
