  <h1>Rental company application ✨ </h1>
  <p>I wrote test cases for the the following application: <a href="https://exercises.test-design.org/rental/" target="_blank">Rental Company app</a>.</p>

  <p>🔎 Before developing the test cases, I analyzed the requirements. </p>

  <p>
   📝 Based on this analysis, I created individual decision tables for each requirement to keep the logic clear and manageable. Each table was 
    optimized to avoid redundant or irrelevant checks, ensuring a clean and focused design.
  </p>

  <p>
   📎 Once the decision tables were finalized, I used them as the foundation for designing test cases.
