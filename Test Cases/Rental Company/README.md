  <h1>Rental company application âœ¨ </h1>
  <p>I wrote test cases for the the following application: <a href="https://exercises.test-design.org/rental/" target="_blank">Rental Company app</a>.</p>

  <p>Before developing the test cases, I analyzed the requirements. 

  <p>After analyzing the requirements, I started designing the decision tables. For more 
  comfortable use, I created solution tables for each requirement. I optimized them to avoid 
  repetitive and irrelevant checks.</p>

  <p>Based on the created decision tables, I started developing test cases.</p>
