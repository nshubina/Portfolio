## üß† My MongoDB Skills

This project demonstrates my ability to work with basic MongoDB operations and queries.

Here‚Äôs what I can do:
- Create a database and collection;
- Insert documents (single and multiple);
- Delete documents (single and multiple);
- Update fields in one document;
- Use find() and findOne() to search for data;
- Filter results by specific field values and combined conditions;
- Use core query operators: $gt, $lt, $or, $and, $in, $nin;
- Apply sorting and limiting to results.
