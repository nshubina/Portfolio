  <h1> ðŸ“‹ Functional specification review using a checklist</h1>
  
  <h1>ðŸ”ŽTask</h1>
  <p>Perform an individual checklist-based review of the specifications for <i>'Browsing Facilities', 'Selecting a Facility', 'Booking Details', and 'Payment Details'</i>.</p>
  <p>Your solution should contain a <b>checklist-based review</b> with answers to the following questions: </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Do all requirements give sufficient detail needed for determining the expected results for tests?</li>
    <li>Are all dependencies and restrictions specified?</li>
    <li>Are alternatives specified for all options?</li> 
  </ol>
  
  <p> Make a <b>list of potential defects</b> in the specification, noting the severity level of each (High, Medium, or Low).<br>
      Note which checklist question has found the defect.</p>

<h1>âœ… My Solution:</h1>
  <p> You can view the solution in Google Sheets at the link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zvXy7c53vkJGOK1HFFpyrAqLX2gu-PKmlX2zIAMi29A/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> My solution </a>.</p>

  <p> Previously, I evaluated requirements by reviewing their quality attributes such as completeness, clarity, consistency, etc.<br>
      This time, I decided to challenge myself and try a new approach: testing the requirements using a checklist.<br><br>
      Adopting the checklist-based approach turned out to be a highly effective decision. The process became more structured, and I uncovered gaps I hadnâ€™t noticed before.<br>
      <i>The checklist helped me analyze the requirements more deeply and ask the right questions early on.</i></p>
  <h3>ðŸ§© Goal:</h3>
  <p>Ensure that requirements are testable, understandable, and complete, helping both developers and testers avoid ambiguity.</p>
  
  <h3>What I did:</h3>
  <ol>
      <li> Used a structured checklist to evaluate the clarity, completeness, and consistency of requirements.</li>
      <li> Identified missing information, unclear logic, and unspecified UI or functional behavior. </li>
      <li> Created a checklist-based review</li>
      <li> Created a list of potential defects categorized by severity (High, Medium, Low) and mapped each to the related checklist question.</li>
      <li> Wrote a brief summary of the requirements problem for each functional module.</li>
  </ol> 
  <h2> About documents in the folder:</h2>
  <ul> 
    <li><b>'Checklist-based testing-<i>{{Name of module}}</i>.pdf'</b></li>
    <p> These documents contain a checklist for reviewing the requirements, along with a list of clarifying questions.</p>
  </ul>
  <ul> 
    <li><b>'Checklist-based testing-<i>{{Name of module}}</i>-Answer.pdf'</b></li> 
    <p> These documents include the checklist-based review, a list of potential defects linked to the related checklist items, and a brief summary.</p>
