# 📊 Airport Database Project

This project was developed in the MS SQL Server environment.<br>
It shows my skills in working with relational databases.

Here you can find the following:<br>
  - <a href="" target="_blank"> 📂 source </a> - contains the database schema and test data.
  -  📂 <a href="https://github.com/nshubina/Portfolio/tree/2396b1d016228ab1872a92f0e9622c92dc489d3c/SQL/Queries" target="_blank">queries </a> – this folder includes SQL queries: each script contains a task and its solution, written using different SQL operators and techniques.
  - <a href="" target="_">📄PDF</a> - In the PDF, I describe my script and the operands I used. It also shows screenshots with results.
  

## 📁 Database tables

This portfolio is based on a custom-built **Airport database**, which includes realistic data and covers the following entities:
- `Company` – airline companies
- `Trip` – flight information
