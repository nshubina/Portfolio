# 📊 Airport Database Project

This project was developed in the MS SQL Server environment. It shows my skills in working with relational databases.

  -  📂 <a href="https://github.com/nshubina/Portfolio/tree/2396b1d016228ab1872a92f0e9622c92dc489d3c/SQL/Queries" target="_blank">queries </a> – folder includes SQL queries: each file contains a task and its solution, written using different SQL operators and techniques.
  -  📄 <a href="https://github.com/nshubina/Portfolio/blob/1a40ee202c9d7c0938defef8d5c26960947158a9/SQL/SQL%20Queries%20Execution.pdf" target="_">SQL Queries Execution.pdf</a> - file describes the scripts and the SQL operators I used. It also includes screenshots with results.<br>

## 📅 Database tables

This portfolio is based on a custom-built **Airport database**, which includes realistic data and covers the following entities:
- `Company` – airline companies
- `Trip` – flight information
- `Passenger` – passenger profiles
- `Pass_in_trip` – ticket/passenger participation in flights

## 🧠 Notes on Query Complexity
The queries are arranged from simple to complex to demonstrate the gradual development of my skills.

## 🛠️ Briwfly, What I Can Do with SQL

### ✅ Basic Querying
- Select data from one or more tables
- Filter using `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `IS NULL`

### ✅ Aggregation and Grouping
- Use of `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- Grouping data with `GROUP BY`
- Filtering groups with `HAVING`

### ✅ Table Joins
- Work with `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`
- Combine multiple tables in queries

### ✅ Subqueries
- Use scalar and correlated subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `HAVING` clauses

### ✅ Sorting & Limiting
- Order data using `ORDER BY`, use of `TOP`, `LIMIT`

### ✅ DML Operations
- Insert new records (`INSERT`)
- Update existing data (`UPDATE`)
- Delete records safely (`DELETE` with `WHERE` clause)

### ✅ Data Analysis Scenarios
- Determine most frequent values
- Find unmatched or missing records
- Track min/max conditions across grouped data
- Analyze trends or totals
