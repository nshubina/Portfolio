## 📅 Database tables

This portfolio is based on a custom-built **Airport database**, which includes realistic data and covers the following entities:
- `Company` – airline companies

## 🧠 Notes on Query Complexity
The queries are arranged from simple to complex to demonstrate the gradual development of my skills.
 
# ✅ My SQL Skills
1. Basic Querying (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, DISTINCT, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN)
2. Table Joins.
3. Aggregations and grouping.
4. Subqueries
5. Sorting & Limiting
6. DML Operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
7. Schema scripting (schema.sql) with proper data types and constraints.
8. Data insertion with clean and ordered INSERT INTO scripts (test_data.sql).
