# ðŸ“Š Airport Database Project

This project was developed in the MS SQL Server environment.<br>
It shows my skills in working with relational databases.

Here you can find the following:<br>
  -  ðŸ“‚ <a href="https://github.com/nshubina/Portfolio/tree/20a253dd2a49fcf62f68ea92af50025bf3cd4569/SQL/source" target="_blank">source </a> - contains the database schema and test data.
  -  ðŸ“‚ <a href="https://github.com/nshubina/Portfolio/tree/2396b1d016228ab1872a92f0e9622c92dc489d3c/SQL/Queries" target="_blank">queries </a> â€“ this folder includes SQL queries: each file contains a task and its solution, written using different SQL operators and techniques.
  -  ðŸ“„ <a href="https://github.com/nshubina/Portfolio/blob/803ea12269aff9114afe4e848bb49bcb8adc9980/SQL/SQL%20Query%20Execution.pdf" target="_">SQL Queries Execution.pdf</a> - this PDF describes the scripts and the SQL operators I used. It also includes screenshots with results.<br>
    The queries are ordered from the simplest to the most complex tasks. I tried to include as many operators as I know and feel confident using.
  
## ðŸ“… Database tables

This portfolio is based on a custom-built **Airport database**, which includes realistic data and covers the following entities:
