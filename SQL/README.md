# 📊 Airport Database Projects

This project demonstrates my skills in working with relational databases. I wrote my queries in Microsoft SQL Server.

## 📁 Database tables

This portfolio is based on a custom-built **Airport database**, which includes realistic data and covers the following entities:
- `Company` – airline companies
- `Trip` – flight information
- `Passenger` – passenger profiles
- `Pass_in_trip` – ticket/passenger participation in flights
