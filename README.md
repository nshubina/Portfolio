<h3> Welcome to my QA portfolio! 👋</h3>

Here, I present my practical experience, skills, and examples of real work in software testing. 🚀

## This portfolio includes:
- 🌞 Small practice projects showing my QA approach;
- ✅ Test documentation: test cases, checklists, test plans, bug reports, RTM matrices;
- 🧩 Using test design techniques to create effective tests;
- 🔍 Exploratory testing tasks;
- 🔌 Manual API testing examples;
- 🧠 SQL query practice for working with relational databases
- 🗂️ Experience with NoSQL databases (MongoDB);
- 🛠️ Practice tasks that reflect my QA process and attention to detail;
- 🎯 Certificates. 

I’m focused on improving test coverage, finding critical bugs, and ensuring software quality. I apply test design techniques to create effective test documentation and scenarios.
