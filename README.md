# ðŸ“„QA Portfolio 
<h3> Greetings and welcome to my portfolio! ðŸ‘‹</h3>

Here I showcase my skills, experience, and practical work in the field of Quality Assurance. ðŸš€

This portfolio includes:
- Small practice projects showing my QA approach
- Examples of test documentation (test cases, checklists, bug reports, etc.)
- 
- API testing tasks
- SQL query practice for testing databases
- Basic experience with MongoDB (NoSQL database)


Iâ€™m focused on improving test coverage, finding critical bugs, and ensuring software quality.
All tasks were completed manually, using real tools and real test data.
