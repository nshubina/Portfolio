  <p> The <b>Pet API, Store API</b>, and <b>User API</b> folders contain different requests. Such as "Add new pet", "Find pet by id", "Delete order by Id", "Get user       by username", "Update user", etc. </p>
  <p>The <b>Tests</b> folder contains tests for the <i>Pet, Store, and User APIs.</i> My tests are designed to verify the accuracy and reliability of select         
  requests. The tests include basic ones, such as checking the status code or response time, as well as more detailed ones, such as checking whether the ID matches the expected one.</p>

  <p>In the "Tests" folder, I placed tests written for Pet API, Store API, and User API. My tests are designed to verify the accuracy and reliability of select requests.

<p>Additionally, you can see a test matrix based on the Swagger documentation.</p>
