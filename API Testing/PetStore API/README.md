<h1>Welcome to the PetStore API folder!</h1>
<div>
  <p>The <b><a href="https://github.com/nshubina/Portfolio/tree/a90f03b829b8e911c8094a874b3179af13f277a6/API%20Testing/PetStore%20API/source" 
              target="_blank">source</a></b> folder contains the "PetStore API" collection and its environment settings in json files. 
  </p>
  <h3>The collection has the following structure (see image below): </h3>

  <p> The <b>Pet API, Store API</b>, and <b>User API</b> folders contain different requests. Such as "Add new pet", "Find pet by id", "Delete order by Id", "Get user       by username", "Update 
   user", etc. </p>
  <p>The <b>Tests</b> folder contains tests for the <i>Pet, Store, and User APIs.</i> My tests are designed to verify the accuracy and reliability of select         
  requests. The tests include basic ones, such as checking the status code or response time, as well as more detailed ones, such as checking whether the ID matches the expected one.</p>
  <p> In this collection, I practiced using dynamic variables (like <i>{{$randomInt}}</i> or <i>{{$randomFirstName}}</i>) in the body of the query to make the input data coverage as large as possible. In addition, I used not only post-responses for tests, but also pre-queries to get the collection variables. You can also see them in the “Tests” folder.</p>
  <p>Additionally, I wrote positive and negative test matrices for each API in the collection based on the Swagger documentation.</p>
